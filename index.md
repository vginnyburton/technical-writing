# Change Manifesto

Many people in our world today are unhappy with their live’s, their appearance, their level of success, and how the rest of the world is living. Changing patterns and perspectives is possible and necessary if one is to have a life worth living. 

## How to change patterns, perspective, and behaviors. 


1. Awareness is key for change: we must be honest with ourselves if we are to make any lasting changes in our lives. Self transparency is not as easy as it sounds. Many of us have a hard time looking within, therefore it is necessary to create awareness. When judging someone else, ask yourself, “do I possess that quality? Do I act in that way? Do I look like that?” often the answer is yes. Awareness begins here. 

2. Explore the situation: once you realize you possess the characteristic that you're judging, ask yourself, "what is my problem with this and is it something you can live with now I am aware of it in me?" If the answer is no, move on to the next step.

3. Take a small step each day: now you must make a commitment to change. Make a list of counter behaviors and attack the problem with one of them when it occurs again. Set an alarm reminding yourself to work on this regularly. Each time the alarm goes off, assess your progress, if you are not where you want to be, recommit to change or improve your solutions. 

4. One behavior at a time: We must focus on one change at a time. Trying to take on too many changes can cause a crash. Things will feel overwhelming and encourage you to give up. So, choose one pattern at a time and gain traction with changing one vice before moving on to the next. 

5. Now, choose another pattern and go back to step one. This process will work in all areas of your life, it is time to commit to the work.
