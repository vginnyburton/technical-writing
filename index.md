# Change Manifesto

Many people in our world today are unhappy with their choices, their appearance, their level of success, and how the rest of the world is living. Changing patterns and perspectives is possible and necessary if one is to have a life worth living.

## How to change patterns, perspective, and behaviors. 


1.### Awareness is key for change 
We must be honest with ourselves if we are to make lasting changes in our lives. There is a need for transparency, and self reflection to bring awareness. 

2.### Explore the situation 
Am I judging? do I do that myself? If so, make changes.

3.### Take a small step each day
Commit to change. List counter behaviors and attack harmful behaviors with a solution.

4.### One behavior at a time
Do not overdo it. Choose one behavior to focus on at a time. 

5.### And, start again
Once you succeed, choose a new behavior and start again.
